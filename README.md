# Connect-Four-TDD
This project is part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) curriculum

The main goal of this project was to practice test driven development. Such style felt really frustrating and I will probably not use it anymore, but I believe that there will be time in the future where I will be needing to test things and learning Rspec will come in handy.
